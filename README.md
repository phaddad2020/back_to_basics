Back to Basics

Who am I?
My name is Phillip Haddad and my previous job was a Senior Principal Software Engineer which unfortunately
got terminated because of the COVID19 pandemic in July 2020.

This is a workspace for me to go back to basics and brush up on data structures/algorithms that we often
take for granted at the high level of software engineering. After 12.5 years at the same company working
in a very slow tech stack moving environment it's very easy to forget some of these basics. The position
which I held saw me working on a very wide range of products at varying levels, one month I could be
working on a driver for our custom hardware or FPGA and then the next month I could be writing high level
C# code with Unity 3D for our games or prototyping something. Of course I was always working with a large
code base unless it's something I was developing from the ground up myself. In order to better prepare myself
for finding a new career I've decided to create this source and remind myself how these things work essentially
building my own base code in which to build other projects on.

Here we will explore fully implemented:
- Linked List
- Queues
- Stacks
- Binary Trees
- Sorting algorithms
- Searching algorithms
- Fun bitwise stuff
- Just a playground of whatever is interesting really...
